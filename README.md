Seeker Algorithm (SeekA) is a single-agent metaheuristic algorithm that exploits the Lévy Flights steps to make progress. In this work, the SeekA is simulated in a set of test functions in two-dimensional space and compared with three other traditional techniques. Results illustrate that with just one parameter tuning for the Lévy distribution, the algorithm performs better in most cases.
